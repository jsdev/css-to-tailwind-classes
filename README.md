# 🌊 CSS to Tailwind Converter

*Because life's too short to manually convert CSS properties one by one*

## What Does This Thing Do? 🤔

Ever found yourself staring at a massive CSS file, wondering how many `justify-content: center` declarations you'd need to convert to `justify-center`? Well, wonder no more! This delightful little tool takes your regular CSS and magically transforms it into Tailwind utility classes faster than you can say "utility-first framework."

It's like having a personal CSS-to-Tailwind translator that works 24/7, doesn't drink your coffee, and never judges you for using `!important` (though we still will, silently).

## Features That'll Make You Go "Wow!" ✨

- 🎯 **Smart CSS Parsing**: Understands your CSS better than your browser's dev tools
- 🔄 **Real-time Conversion**: See results as you type (it's basically magic)
- 📱 **Mobile Responsive**: Because someone might actually use this on their phone (we don't judge)
- 📋 **One-Click Copying**: Copy individual classes or grab them all at once
- ⚠️ **Honest Feedback**: Tells you when something can't be converted (with reasons!)
- 🎨 **Beautiful Dark Theme**: Easy on the eyes during those late-night coding sessions

## Getting Started 🚀

1. Clone this bad boy:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/css-tailwind-converter.git
   cd css-tailwind-converter
   ```

2. Install the dependencies (the usual suspects):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Fire it up:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` and start converting!

## How to Use (It's Easier Than Making Toast) 🍞

1. Paste your CSS in the left panel
2. Watch the magic happen in the right panel
3. Copy the Tailwind classes you need
4. Profit! 💰
